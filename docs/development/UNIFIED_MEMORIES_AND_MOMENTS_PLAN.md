# Unified Memories and Cafe Moments Plan

## Overview

This plan unifies the Memory Journal system and Cafe Moments (formerly Blog) into a cohesive experience that enhances NPC relationships and creates meaningful player narratives.

## Core Concept

### Memory Journal (Private Collection)
- **Purpose**: Personal collection of cafe memories
- **Access**: Bottom navigation "Journal" icon
- **Function**: Browse, filter, and relive special moments
- **Feel**: Like a personal diary/scrapbook

### Cafe Moments (Public Sharing)
- **Purpose**: Share special moments with the community
- **Access**: 4th section card on main Cafe screen
- **Function**: Curated public-facing moments that build cafe reputation
- **Feel**: Like a cafe's social media presence

## Current State Analysis

### What Currently Exists
1. **Memory Generation**
   - Memories generated at 100% rate after shifts
   - Each memory has: content, mood, location, tagged NPCs, pet IDs
   - Templates exist for each cafe section
   - Memories stored but not immediately visible

2. **Publishing System**
   - Memory Selection Screen ‚Üí Caption ‚Üí Publish flow
   - Published memories generate engagement metrics
   - NPC reactions for published posts
   - Disconnected from core gameplay loop

### Key Issues
1. **Discovery Problem**: Players don't know memories are being created
2. **No Immediate Gratification**: Memories hidden until blog publishing
3. **Lack of Visual Appeal**: Camera icons instead of actual images
4. **Disconnected Systems**: Memories and Blog feel separate
5. **Generic Feel**: Doesn't integrate with cafe/NPC theme
6. **No Collection Management**: Can't browse or organize memories
