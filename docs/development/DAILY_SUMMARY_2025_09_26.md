# Daily Development Summary - September 26, 2025

## Overview
Today focused on significant UI improvements and polish for the Cafe Section screens, transforming them into profile-style layouts similar to the Pet Profile screen. We also fixed critical issues with shift completion modals and implemented a better rewards notification system.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Cafe Section Screen Redesign
- **Profile-Style Layout**: Redesigned Section screens to follow Pet Profile's visual hierarchy
  - Added 320px hero section with NPC portraits
  - Implemented NPC-specific gradient backgrounds (Aria: gold, Kai: blue, Elias: purple)
  - Created centered header with section names
  - Organized content into distinct white blocks with clear titles
  - Added Material Icons throughout for visual consistency

- **Section Name Updates**:
  - Aria's section: "Bakery" (was "Cat Lounge")
  - Kai's section: "Playground" (was "Puppy Patio")
  - Elias's section: "Salon" (was "Bird Bistro")

- **UI Cleanup**:
  - Removed section badges and bond stats (too cluttered)
  - Removed "View Scene" button (not yet implemented)
  - Made pet grid flexible height (removed scrollbar)
  - Centered single "Chat with [NPC]" button

### 2. Shift Completion Modal Fixes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added `completingShifts` Set to ShiftManager to prevent multiple simultaneous completions
- **Removed Timer-Based Completion**: Simplified to use only update loop for completion detection
- **Screen-Specific Modals**: Modal only shows if player is on the correct Section screen
- **Pending Rewards System**: If player is on different screen, rewards are stored and shown when entering the section

### 3. Cafe Overview Enhancements
- **Dynamic Status Badges**:
  - "Ready" (green) - No active shift
  - Time remaining (blue) - Shift in progress
  - "Collect Rewards!" (gold, pulsing) - Shift complete
- **Real-time Updates**: Status badges update via event listeners
- **Visual Feedback**: Pulsing animation draws attention to completed shifts

### 4. Pet Card Improvements
- **Enhanced Structure**: Pet cards in cafe sections now match collection view
- **NPC Affinity Tags**: Shows which NPC the pet belongs to
- **Rarity Badges**: Displays 3-star, 4-star, or 5-star rating
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified appearance across all pet displays

### 5. Bug Fixes
- Fixed instant finish not showing rewards modal (visibility check issue)
- Fixed missing `getNPCById` import in SectionScreen
- Removed duplicate `getCurrentScreen` method in UIManager
- Fixed bond level access (using `getPlayer().npcBonds` instead of non-existent method)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
- `src/ui/SectionScreen.ts`: Complete redesign with new HTML structure
- `src/styles/section-profile.css`: New stylesheet for profile-style layout
- `src/systems/ShiftManager.ts`: Added duplicate prevention mechanism
- `src/ui/UnifiedCafeScreen.ts`: Added dynamic status badge updates
- `src/validation/validate-all.js`: Added tests for all new features

### New Systems
- **Pending Rewards**: Stores rewards if player navigates away before collection
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses Set to track completing shifts
- **Profile Layout Pattern**: Reusable design pattern for character-focused screens

## Validation & Testing
- Added 7 new validation tests for today's features
- All tests passing in validation suite
- Manual testing confirmed all features working correctly

## Impact on User Experience
- **Cleaner Interface**: Removed clutter, focused on essential information
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Profile-style layout emphasizes NPC relationships
- **Improved Feedback**: Clear status indicators for shift states
- **Prevented Frustration**: No more duplicate modals or missed rewards
- **Consistent Design**: Unified visual language across screens

## Next Steps
- Continue with Week 8 story unlock implementation
- Build conversation topic unlock system
- Implement scene framework for story moments
- Add pet affinity tracking system
- Create first milestone scenes for each NPC

## Notes
- The profile-style layout for sections creates a stronger emotional connection to NPCs
- The shift completion fixes significantly improve gameplay flow
- UI is now more mobile-friendly with larger touch targets and clearer information
- Ready to proceed with narrative/story implementation building on this solid UI foundation
