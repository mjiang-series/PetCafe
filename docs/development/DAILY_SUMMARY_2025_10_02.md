# Daily Development Summary - October 2, 2025

## Overview
Today focused on major game design pivot from NPC-centric to pet-centric gameplay, implementing an interactive map-based quest system, fixing critical UI/UX bugs, and polishing the progression system. We transformed the game from a relationship sim with pets into a pet collection game with supporting NPCs.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Game Design Pivot: Pet-First Gameplay
- **Filter System Overhaul**: Changed all filters from NPC names (Aria, Kai, Elias) to Cafe Areas (Bakery, Playground, Salon)
  - Updated Pet Collection screen filters with area-themed placeholder images
  - Updated Journal screen filters to match Pet Collection styling
  - Removed "None" filter from Journal (no longer needed)
  
- **Pet Affinity Changes**: Updated pet cards throughout the game
  - Changed affinity tags from NPC names to Cafe Area names
  - Removed "+5" bond points display (no longer relevant)
  - Used transparent pet portraits (`_portrait_transparent.png`) for better visual clarity
  - Increased pet portrait size to 120px (from 80px) to showcase pets prominently

- **Pet Profile Improvements**:
  - 3-star and 4-star pets now use full `_portrait.png` as hero image
  - 5-star pets retain cinematic video (`pet_profile_hero_placeholder_cinematic.mp4`)
  - Memory video now fits screen width (mobile) or height (desktop) correctly

- **Blog System Removal**: Removed NPC-focused content
  - Removed `relationship-spotlight` container from Cafe menu
  - Removed `Cafe Stories` section (blog access point)
  - Shifted focus entirely to pet collection and cafe management

### 2. Interactive Map-Based Quest System
- **Quest System Implementation**: Replaced static shift system for Bakery section (prototype)
  - 5 unique quest markers per cafe section with dynamic positions
  - Locked/unlocked slot system based on player level
  - Pet trait matching requirements for each quest
  - Visual quest markers with animations (pulse, float, glow)
  
- **Quest Modal Design**: Created comprehensive quest assignment interface
  - Quest description and trait requirements
  - Pet selector showing only eligible pets (filtered by special trait)
  - Rewards calculator with rarity multipliers
  - "Go to Adopt" button when no eligible pets available
  
- **Quest Persistence**: Full state management system
  - Active quests persist across navigation
  - Quest timers and completion states tracked
  - Pet animations and countdown timers on map
  - Quest completion rewards include memory generation

- **Quest Data Structure**: Created 15 unique quests across 3 cafe sections
  - Variable durations: 3, 5, 8, 12, 18, 27, 40, 60, 90, 150 minutes
  - Unique positions per section for visual variety
  - 15 unique special traits matched to quests

### 3. Progression System Overhaul
- **Level-Based Unlocking**: Implemented token-based quest slot unlocking
  - Player starts at Level 1 with 6 unlocked slots (2 per section)
  - Each level grants +1 unlock token to spend
  - Unlock tokens + 1000 coins required to unlock a slot
  - Maximum 5 slots per section (15 total at max level)

- **Player Leveling**: Updated level requirements
  - Level 1: 120-149 cafe visitors
  - Level 2: 150-249 visitors
  - Level 3: 250-499 visitors
  - Level 4: 500-999 visitors
  - Level 5+: +1000 visitors per level

- **Unlock Modals**: Context-aware dialogs for locked slots
  - Can unlock (with tokens + coins): Shows cost and confirms
  - Can't afford: Shows coins needed, encourages task completion
  - No tokens available: Explains need to level up

### 4. Gacha System Refinements
- **Two-Stage Reveal**: Redesigned bulk pull summary
  - Stage 1: Grid showing all pets collected with "NEW" badges
  - Stage 2: Coins earned from duplicates summary
  - Single pulls skip pet grid, show only coins if duplicate
  
- **Button Improvements**: Better UX for reveal navigation
  - Single pull: Only "Done" button
  - Bulk pull: "Next" (primary) and "Skip All" (subtle) buttons
  - Removed redundant "SKIP" button from single pulls

- **Tab System**: Added Standard and Limited Time event tabs
  - Distinct hero banners for each tab
  - Different button colors (purple gradient for Limited)
  - Same currency/pool for now (ready for future expansion)

### 5. Currency & Shop System
- **Diamond Currency**: Implemented premium currency shop
  - 6 purchase offers (150, 380, 980, 1980, 4980, 9980 diamonds)
  - "BEST VALUE" badge on 980 diamonds offer
  - "POPULAR" badge on 380 diamonds offer
  - Shop accessible via "+" button in persistent header

- **Bonus Rewards**: Gacha ticket system
  - +1 ticket for every 5 quests completed
  - Displayed prominently in rewards modal
  - Tracked via `totalQuestsCompleted` statistic

### 7. Tutorial & Notification System
- **Alert Notification System**: Created character-based tutorial alerts
  - Muffin's portrait displayed with each alert
  - 3-second display duration
  - Sequential queue system (non-stacking)
  - Tutorial flags prevent repeat displays

- **Tutorial Triggers**: 5 key tutorial moments
  - New game: "We're so happy you're here!"
  - First cafe section: "Pets help bring visitors!"

### 8. Badge & New Pet System

  - Pets not scrolled into view retain "NEW" badge

- **Pet Sorting**: Updated collection display order
  - NEW pets appear first (sorted by rarity, then alphabetical)
  - Existing pets follow (same sorting)
  - Unowned pets hidden from display

### 9. UI/UX Polish & Bug Fixes
- **Persistent Header Reorganization**: Two-zone layout
  - Left zone (Progression): Player portrait + Level → Cafe Visitors
  - Right zone (Economy): Coins OR Tickets → Diamonds → Notifications
  - Screen-specific currency visibility (Cafe shows coins, Gacha shows tickets)

- **Desktop Layout Fixes**:
  - Bottom navigation now centers correctly (max-width: 600px at 768px+)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Test quest system with remaining cafe sections (Playground, Salon)

3. Implement pet leveling/upgrade system
4. Create more memory templates for variety
5. Add quest completion animations

### Future Enhancements
