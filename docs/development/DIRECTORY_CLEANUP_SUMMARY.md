# Directory Cleanup Summary

Date: September 24, 2025

## Overview

Cleaned up the PetCafe project directory to improve organization and remove unnecessary files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Debug/Test Files
Deleted the following temporary debug and test files from the root directory:
- `check-mobile.html`
- `debug-bottom-nav.html`
- `debug.html`
- `test-mobile-layout.html`
- `test-simple.html`
- `run-validation.html`
- `bottom-nav-test.js`
- `debug-nav-commands.js`
- `debug-start-button.js`
- `switch-to-mobile.js`
- `test-mobile-desktop.js`

### 2. Organized Documentation
Created a structured documentation hierarchy in the `/docs` directory:

#### `/docs/assets/`
Moved all CSV asset tracking files:
- `assets_dimensions_reference.csv`
- `assets_needed_audio.csv`
- `assets_needed_npcs.csv`
- `assets_needed_pets.csv`
- `assets_needed_ui_scenes.csv`
- `assets_summary_with_specs.csv`
- `assets_summary.csv`

#### `/docs/development/`
Moved all development-related documentation:
- Fix summaries (ASSET_PATH*, BOTTOM_NAV*, etc.)
- Implementation docs (MOBILE_*, VALIDATION_*, etc.)
- Weekly summaries and checklists
- Troubleshooting guides

#### `/docs/game-design/`
Moved all game design documents:
- `PetCafe_GameSpec.md`
- `PetCafe_GameSpec_AssetsPlan.md`
- `PetCafe_NewPlayerJourney_V0.md`
- `PetCafe_ProjectPlan_VerticalSlice.md`
- `PetCafe_WeeklyTestingPlan.md`

### 3. Created Scripts Directory
- Created `/scripts` directory for utility scripts
- Moved `serve-dist.js` to `/scripts/`
- Updated `package.json` to reflect new script location

### 4. Cleaned Up Tests Directory
Removed redundant validation files:
- `week2-validation.js` (kept `week2-validation-full.js`)
- `final-validation.html`

## Result

The project now has a cleaner, more organized structure:
- Root directory contains only essential files (index.html, package.json, README, etc.)
- Documentation is properly categorized in `/docs`
- Scripts are organized in `/scripts`
- Source code remains in `/src`
- Tests are consolidated in `/tests`
- Assets remain in `/assets`

This organization makes it easier to:
- Find relevant documentation
- Understand the project structure
- Focus on active development files
- Share the project with others
