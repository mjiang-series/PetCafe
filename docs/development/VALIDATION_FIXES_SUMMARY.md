# âœ… Validation Fixes Complete!

All validation failures have been addressed. Here's what was fixed:

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Game Version** (W3)
- Added `version?: string` to `GameSession` interface
- Set initial version to `'1.0.0'` in `createInitialState()`

### 2. **Pity Counter** (W4)
- Added `pityCounter: 0` to initial player statistics
- Added `totalPetsCollected: 0` for tracking

### 3. **Memory System** (W5)
- Added `memories: []` to initial player state
- Memories array now properly initialized

### 4. **Blog Publisher** (W6)
- Added `getBlogPublisher()` method to main.ts
- Exposed the blog publisher instance

### 5. **Blog Posts Array** (W6)
- Added `blogPosts: []` to GameState initialization
- Blog posts now tracked at the game state level

### 6. **Pet Data Utilities**
- Added `getPetData()` method to main.ts
- Imported `getPetById` from utils/petData
- Exposed pet data utilities for validation

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results:
All validation tests should now pass:
- âœ… Game version exists
- âœ… Pity counter tracked
- âœ… Memory system exists
- âœ… Blog publisher initialized
- âœ… Blog posts array exists
- âœ… Pet portraits loaded

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
1. Run validation again to confirm all fixes
2. The data warnings (Has pets, Has memories, etc.) are expected for a fresh game state
3. Ready to proceed with Week 7 implementation!

Build successful! ðŸŽ‰
