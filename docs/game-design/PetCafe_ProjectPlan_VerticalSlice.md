## 4. Live Operations Management System

### Overview
To enable rapid iteration and balancing without code changes, the game will support external configuration through CSV files or Google Sheets. This allows non-technical team members to adjust game parameters, add content, and run events.

### Configuration Architecture

#### Data Sources
1. **Local CSV Files** (Development)
   - Quick iteration during development
   - Version controlled with Git
   - Easy to edit with any spreadsheet tool

2. **Google Sheets Integration** (Production)
   - Real-time updates without deployment
   - Access control and change history
   - Comments and collaboration features
   - Automatic backup and versioning

### Configurable Parameters

#### Economy Configuration
```csv
parameter_id,value,min_value,max_value,description
base_shift_coins,30,10,100,"Base coins earned per shift"
shift_duration_minutes,3,1,10,"Default shift duration"
memory_generation_chance,1.0,0.1,1.0,"Chance to generate memory"
viral_post_multiplier,10,5,20,"Subscriber gain multiplier for viral posts"
gacha_single_cost,100,50,500,"Cost for single gacha pull"
gacha_multi_cost,900,450,4500,"Cost for 10x gacha pull"
```

#### Pet Configuration
```csv

cat_siamese,Mocha,rare,cat-lounge,1.2,1
cat_persian,Duchess,ultra_rare,cat-lounge,1.5,1
dog_shiba,Mochi,common,puppy-patio,1.0,1
```

#### NPC Configuration

```

#### Memory Templates
```csv
template_id,mood,rarity,content_template,tags
mem_001,joyful,common,"{pet1} had a blast helping {npc} in the {section}!",fun;pets;cafe
mem_002,peaceful,common,"A quiet afternoon with {pet1} in the {section}.",calm;relax
mem_003,playful,rare,"{pet1} caused delightful mischief today!",playful;mischief
```

### Implementation Details

#### CSV Loader System
```typescript
class ConfigLoader {
  private configs: Map<string, any[]> = new Map();
  
  async loadCSV(filename: string): Promise<void> {
    const response = await fetch(`/data/configs/${filename}`);
    const text = await response.text();
    const data = this.parseCSV(text);
    this.configs.set(filename, data);
  }
  
  getConfig(filename: string): any[] {
    return this.configs.get(filename) || [];
  }
}
```

#### Google Sheets Integration
```typescript
class GoogleSheetsLoader {
  private readonly SHEET_ID = 'your-sheet-id';
  private readonly API_KEY = process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY;
  
  async loadSheet(sheetName: string): Promise<any[]> {
    const url = `https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/${this.SHEET_ID}/values/${sheetName}?key=${this.API_KEY}`;
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    return this.parseSheetData(data.values);
  }
}
```

### Live Events System

#### Event Configuration
```csv
event_id,start_date,end_date,event_type,multipliers,special_rewards
summer_2025,2025-07-01,2025-07-31,seasonal,coins:2;xp:1.5,summer_pet_01
valentine_2025,2025-02-01,2025-02-14,holiday,bonds:2;subs:2,valentine_frame
```

#### A/B Testing Configuration
```csv
test_id,variant,parameter,value,user_percentage
gacha_rates_v1,control,ultra_rare_rate,0.03,50
gacha_rates_v1,variant_a,ultra_rare_rate,0.05,50
```

### Benefits

1. **Rapid Iteration**: Balance changes without code deployment
2. **Non-Technical Access**: Designers can adjust parameters directly
3. **Event Management**: Run time-limited events easily
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different configurations on user segments
5. **Emergency Fixes**: Quick response to balance issues
6. **Content Expansion**: Add new pets, NPCs, memories without coding

### Security Considerations

1. **Validation**: All loaded values must be validated against min/max ranges
2. **Caching**: Cache configurations locally with TTL
3. **Fallbacks**: Always have default values if loading fails
4. **Rate Limiting**: Limit configuration refresh frequency
5. **Authentication**: Secure Google Sheets API access

---

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Build static fallback system first, add AI as enhancement
   - *Timeline Buffer*: 1 week additional if AI features are required

2. **Mobile Performance**
   - *Mitigation*: Regular testing on low-end devices, performance budgets
   - *Optimization*: Sprite atlases, object pooling, efficient animations

3. **Live Ops Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Start with local CSV, add Google Sheets later
   - *Testing*: Automated validation of all configuration changes

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Save System Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Robust versioning and migration system
   
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - *Mitigation*: Regular testing on iOS Safari, Android Chrome

3. **Configuration Errors**
   - *Mitigation*: Validation layer, safe defaults, rollback capability
